School Project - Creating an Individual Website

This is a simple website that I created as an individual project during my high school coursework. The goal was to develop a functional and accessible website, putting into practice the skills I learned in the course.

I conceived and implemented the design of the site, selected and organized the content, and chose the technologies to be used in its creation. Through this project, I had the opportunity to become familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are fundamental to creating intuitive and pleasing web interfaces.

This experience provided me with a solid foundation for further study in the areas of web development and user interface design.
